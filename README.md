# Sorting Visualization
### This is a simple Sorting visualization project made using HTML, CSS, javascript 
- Bubble Sort - The bubble sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list of elements to be sorted. In each pass, it compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, moving the larger element towards the end of the list.

- <hr>Selection Sort</hr> - Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum (or maximum, depending on the sorting order) element from the unsorted part of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated until the entire list becomes sorted.

- Insertion Sort - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time. It takes each element from the input list and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list. The algorithm repeats this process until the entire list becomes sorted.

- Quick Sort - Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that picks a 'pivot' element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sublists, such that elements less than the pivot are moved to the left sublist, and elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right sublist. The algorithm then recursively sorts the two sublists and combines them, resulting in a sorted list.

- Merge Sort - Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input list into smaller halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves to create a fully sorted list.
